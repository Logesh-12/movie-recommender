🎬 Movie Recommendation System Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System, a mini-project designed to provide intelligent, personalized movie suggestions to users based on their input. Built using Python, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and machine learning libraries, this system demonstrates the powerful potential of collaborative filtering and content-based techniques to enhance user experience in modern streaming platforms.

🚀 Project Overview In today's digital era, users are overwhelmed by the abundance of movies and TV shows. This system helps cut through the noise by recommending movies that align with the user’s tastes and preferences.

Using techniques like TF-IDF vectorization, cosine similarity, and collaborative filtering, our system analyzes movie metadata and user behavior to generate top-notch suggestions in real time.

💡 Features 🔍 Search by Movie Title – Type a movie name and get instant suggestions.

🎯 Top-5 Similar Movies – Uses vector-based similarity scoring for accurate results.

📊 Collaborative Filtering – Recommends based on similar users' preferences.

🌐 Interactive Web Interface – Built with HTML, CSS, and Flask for an easy-to-use UI.

📈 Scalable & Efficient – Built to handle large datasets and adapt to user feedback.
